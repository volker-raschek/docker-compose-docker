This project contains all sources to build the container image `docker.io/volkerraschek/docker-compose`. The primary
goal of this project is to package the binary `docker-compose` as container image. The source code of the binary can be
found in the upstream project of [docker/compose](https://github.com/docker/compose).

The workflow or how `docker-compose` can in general be used is documented [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
